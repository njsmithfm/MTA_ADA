# MTA_ADA
A dashboard of MTA ADA-accessible subway stations and their rates of operability (availability to users).
It includes the most-recent 6 months of data as small multiples, which I automated using the Datawrapper API and GitHub Actions. I thank Ben Welsh for his numerous tutorials, and in this project I used his documentation on [Python together with the Datawrapper API](https://palewi.re/docs/first-automated-chart).

Datasets included: 
- [MTA Subway Accessible Station Platform Availability: Beginning 2018](https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.ny.gov/thh2-syn7)
- [MTA Subway Stations](https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/MTA-Subway-Stations/39hk-dx4f/about_data)
